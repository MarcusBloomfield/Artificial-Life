# Artificial-Life
A Simple simulation of the simple life.

## Description
This is a simple simulation of primitive attraction relationships between spheres I made in unity using c# for fun. 
The project demonstrates the ability of simple rules to create complex and unpredicted behaviors.
The size, relationships, and colors of the particles are completely randomized upon creation.

## Observations
The particle beings seem more unstable due to the lack of constraints on the third axis, making structures much harder to identify.
Additionally, the lack of constraints has the effect of making the structures mostly spheres with layers.

## Controls
R to randomize.
WASD to move around.
C to move down.
Space to move up.
